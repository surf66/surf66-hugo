Hi, I'm Tom and I'm a Software Engineer from the North West of England. I'm 25 and have been working in the web industry now full-time for 4 years.

After completing my degree at Edge Hill University, I started out at [The Hut Group](http://www.thehutgroup.com/), the UK's leading, multi-website online retailer. I joined the business as a Graduate Front-End Web Developer and loved it. Working at the Hut gave me the chance to work on some big sites, attracting millions of users each month such as [myprotein](http://www.myprotein.com), [zavvi](http://www.zavvi.com) and [lookfantastic](http://www.lookfantastic.com). Recently I left my role at the Hut to go and work for [Zuto](https://www.zuto.com), right in the heart of Manchester.

When I’m not working you’ll find me doing things you’d expect a guy in his early twenties to be doing. Playing football, video games and drinking beer with friends. I’m a huge Wigan Athletic fan, occasional surfer and I’m pretty good at pool.

So, yeah – that’s a little bit about me.
