I am an experienced, passionate software engineer based in Warrington and am currently working in Liverpool. I don’t like the term ‘Full Stack’, I consider myself a ’T’ shaped engineer with a skillset predominantly focused on front end technologies such as JavaScript. I am confident and comfortable working on other parts of the tech stack using my skills in .NET Core and Terraform. I love writing clean code, automated testing, infrastructure as code and learning new things.
