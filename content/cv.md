## Personal Profile
I am a software engineer, based in Manchester and have been working in the web industry for 4 years. During that time I have worked on some large scale international brands, such as [Myprotein](https://www.myprotein.com), [Look Fantastic](https://www.lookfantastic.com), [Zavvi](https://www.zavvi.com) and [Nintendo](https://store.nintendo.co.uk).

I am a 'T' shaped engineer with a skillset predominantly focused on front end technologies. However, I am comfortable  working on other parts of the tech stack. I am a very confident person who enjoys discussing technical solutions as part of a cross functional team.

I have a very good knowledge of software design patterns and I believe in writing clean, testable code while following the TDD development process. Over 4 years in industry, I have gained some good experience working in an agile manner, following both Kanban and Scrum.

## Work Experience
### Zuto (2015-Present)
When I joined Zuto as a Software Engineer, I was placed in the acquisition squad. My responsibility was to create seamless interfaces for Zuto’s affiliate partners including AutoTrader, Money Supermarket, Gumtree and AA Cars. To achieve this I generated a web static page for each affiliate, based off a single Handlebars template. 

From within the dealer pillar, I worked in a cross functional team on a specific business area. For 18 months I worked on Zuto's first secure account area for customers. During this project I practiced TDD by writing JavaScript unit tests in Jasmine. I also decided on our tech choice for writing automated acceptance tests in WebDriverIO and running them in PhantomJS.

Another key deliverable I helped developed was a vehicle search tool inside Zuto's account area. As well as an Angular front end, we integrated vehicles from AutoTrader and several car dealerships. I worked on this feature since the beginning and currently 20% of customers find a vehicle digitally, creating business efficiencies through time saving. 

More recently, I have been involved in another new project at Zuto. As part of a small squad, I have helped architect and deliver a conversational style car finance application form, using technologies such as ReactJS and Redux.

While rebranding the current experience at Zuto, myself and another engineer designed and built a new CSS library for the entire front end. We chose to use Atomic Design as a methodology for our design system. This has given me the experience of building and maintaining a front end styleguide [(Zuto Styleguide)](https://styleguide.zuto.com/design/pattern-library).

During my 10% time on Firdays, I have developed a couple of small applications for the business. The first, a small web application where developers can easily switch feature toggles on and off in QA and live. The second, a real time dashboard built in ReactJS showing search terms as customers search for vehicles.
 
### The Hut Group (2013-2015)
After graduating from university, I started work as a front end web developer at The Hut Group. During my time here I learnt to work fast and to tight deadlines. When I first started at The Hut I was mainly involved in front end development and was responsible for completing BAU tasks, bug fixes and the implementation of new site features on The Hut Group's ecommerce platform. I also worked on implementing redesigns of two major sites and the build of a completely new site. I  optimised the  JavaScript on The Hut Group's mobile sites, using RequireJS, and also wrote a small library of SASS mixins, to apply styles to a common template for widgets used across the ecommerce platform. 
 
In April 2014 I was chosen to work on a new team that had been specifically put together to develop a new templating engine and RESTful API layer, to interface with the existing legacy systems. Whilst working on this new team I was exposed to several technologies that I hadn’t worked with before such as NodeJS, Java, Gradle, Selenium WebDriver and GO. This was a great opportunity for me to broaden my knowledge of how the backend and the rest of the tech stack worked, as I was involved in the entire process - from the development of the application, both front and back end, to deployment.

### Add People (2011-2013)
While studying at university, I was able to experience what it was like working in the web industry in my temporary role at Add People in Altrincham. My duties here included building simple websites and small ecommerce websites using technologies such as WordPress, WooCommerce, OpenCart and Magento. My role here was for one day a week during my first and second years at university.

## Interests and Activities
When I’m not working you’ll find me doing things you’d expect a guy in his mid twenties to be doing. Playing football, video games, drinking beer with friends and traveling. I’m a huge Wigan Athletic fan, occasional surfer and I’m pretty good at pool. I also like to get involved in development related events such as Hack Manchester and more recently, Homeless Hack Manchester.
 
I have a clean driving licence and have my own transport.
